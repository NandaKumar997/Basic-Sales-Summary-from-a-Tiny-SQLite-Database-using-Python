# Basic-Sales-Summary-from-a-Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python
Performing a basic sales summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python
created the  detailed summary of the daily sales performance, based on the simulated output data and bar chart.
The peak sales day was observed on 2025-06-01
ðŸ”¼ Highest total sales: $400
ðŸ”¼ Highest average order value: $200
This shows that customers placed larger or more valuable orders on this day.
Created the Bar Chart Interpretation
The bar height reflects total revenue per day.
The steep decline from June 1st to June 3rd suggests a possible trend or event affecting sales.
This helps to identify days with strong performance (to replicate) and days with weak performance (to investigate).
